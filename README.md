Three files were used in order to create this app. The runner file is used to run the entire program. 
Afterwards, the backend is created in order to extract the information from an API. The JSON response is parsed through in order ot find the data to output to the user.  
The last file is used to create the Java Graphical User Interface and output it to the user. Different text areas and buttons are used to add to the user experience. 
The front end also contains the listener events when the user interacts with the interface.
